# RESTy

Business Requirements
Refer to the RESTy System Overview for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

## Phase 1 Requirements (Class 26)

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

Refactor the RESTy application as follows:

### Technical Requirements / Notes

*The application, as written by our development team was done using class components as a proof of concept. In order to go to production, weâ€™re going to have to convert this to an application written using React function components so that our foundation is both stable and high performing.*


Refactor the RESTy application as follows:

1) Convert all child components of App.js from classes to functions
The App component serves as the container for all sub-components of this application.
Leave this component as a Class.
Make sure all base styles for App are included in a .scss imported within App.js.
Ensure that the Header, Footer, Results and Form components are imported using ES6 import syntax.

2) Use .scss files to style each component
Each of the components use their own .scss file for styling.

3) Core application functionality should remain unchanged:
The <Form> component should:
Call a function on submit that updates the <App/> component via a function sent down as a prop so that the app can process the form values.

4) The <Results/> component should show mock API results.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
